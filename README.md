# Pokedex

## Instalation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run `flutter run`! :D

## Notes

- I used the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) to get the data.
- I used bloc & cubits to manage the state of the app. But I would be able to use Provider, or simple setState
- I did some things useless for a small project, but it were for demostrate my skills.
- There are some things missed like .env but that I think that are not necessary for this demo project.

## If there is any problem, please let me know

I often have problems with kotlin and dart sdk versions, so if you get any error on the instalation, please let me know and I will try to fix it as soon as possible! :D

## Tip

If you want to look the app, but you don't want install all the project, you can download the apk from here:
